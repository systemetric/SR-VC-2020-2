Competition simulator is at
https://www.studentrobotics.org/docs/competition-simulator/ I advise you
to use an IDE to program python in which isn't the one on the simulator
such as Visual Studio Code (prefered) or IDLE.
Python can be downloaded
from https://www.python.org/downloads/
A version around 3.7 will be used
in the competition.
On learning python, I haven't watched the videos
myself but MrBrownCS has a playlist on python programming at
