Team 2 problems:

The robot is slow to move to cube when not aligned with it properly
If the robot drops the cube, it won't go back for it (as in it thinks it has got the cube but has then dropped it)
The robot will only go for 2 distinct silver cubes - path finding algorithms may be needed if it is to pick up more ground based silver cubes
The robot can't align well with a cube at an angle. It will fail to pick this cube up especially if at 45 degree angle to it
At the start, the offset to align the robot with the first silver cube can vary from barely any movement to turning it into a wall.
